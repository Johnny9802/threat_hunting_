  Adversaries enumerate remote systems to identify targets for lateral movement:
  1. net view, net group commands
  2. nltest /dclist
  3. ping sweeps
  4. PowerShell AD module queries
  5. arp cache enumeration

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - "Review the user context performing discovery"
  - "Check for subsequent lateral movement attempts"
  - "Analyze scope of discovery (single host vs network-wide)"
  - "Correlate with authentication events"
  - "Review time of discovery activity"

false_positives:
  - "System administrators"
  - "Monitoring tools"
  - "Inventory software"
