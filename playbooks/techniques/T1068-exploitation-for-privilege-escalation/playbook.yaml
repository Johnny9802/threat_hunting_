  Privilege escalation exploits include:
  1. Kernel driver vulnerabilities
  2. Service binary hijacking
  3. DLL hijacking
  4. Token manipulation
  5. Vulnerable software exploitation

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - Review crash dumps for exploitation artifacts
  - Check for known exploit signatures in process memory
  - Identify the vulnerability being exploited
  - Check for post-exploitation activity

false_positives:
  - Software bugs
  - Legitimate debugging
  - Development testing
