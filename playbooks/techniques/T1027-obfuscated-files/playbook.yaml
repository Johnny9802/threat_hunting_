  Obfuscation techniques include:
  1. Base64 encoding
  2. XOR encoding
  3. String concatenation
  4. Variable substitution
  5. Compression and packing

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - Decode obfuscated content
  - Analyze deobfuscated payload
  - Check for known malware signatures
  - Identify C2 addresses or IOCs

false_positives:
  - Legitimate encoded data
  - DRM software
  - Compiled code
