  Credential dumping via LSASS:
  1. Mimikatz and variants
  2. ProcDump abuse
  3. Task Manager memory dump
  4. comsvcs.dll MiniDump
  5. Direct LSASS access

investigation_steps:
  - Identify the process accessing LSASS
  - Check for credential usage after dump
  - Review authentication logs for compromised accounts
  - Force password reset for potentially compromised accounts

false_positives:
  - Legitimate memory dumps for debugging
  - AV/EDR scanning LSASS
