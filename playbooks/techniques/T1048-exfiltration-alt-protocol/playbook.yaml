  Alternative exfiltration methods:
  1. DNS tunneling
  2. ICMP tunneling
  3. Custom encrypted protocols
  4. Steganography

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - Identify the protocol being used
  - Check data volume transferred
  - Review destination reputation
  - Identify affected systems

false_positives:
  - VPN traffic
  - Legitimate encrypted protocols
  - Cloud backup
