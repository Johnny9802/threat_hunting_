  Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications for initial access.
  Common targets include:
  1. SQL Injection attacks
  2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) attempts
  3. Path traversal attacks
  4. Log4j/Spring4Shell type exploits
  5. Authentication bypass attempts

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - Identify specific CVE or vulnerability being exploited
  - Check if exploit was successful (response codes, subsequent connections)
  - Review application logs for post-exploitation activity
  - Identify affected systems and scope of compromise
  - Check for webshell uploads or backdoor creation

false_positives:
  - Vulnerability scanners
  - Penetration testing
  - WAF false positives
