  Adversaries exfiltrate data through the same channel used for C2:
  1. Large HTTP POST requests to suspicious domains
  2. Encrypted data in DNS TXT records
  3. Chunked data transfer patterns
  4. Unusual outbound data volumes
  5. Base64 encoded data in HTTP headers

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - "Analyze network traffic volume anomalies"
  - "Review HTTP request/response sizes"
  - "Check for encoded data in unusual fields"
  - "Correlate with known C2 infrastructure"
  - "Identify data types being exfiltrated"

false_positives:
  - "Cloud backup services"
  - "File sync applications"
  - "Large email attachments"
